        <p>Express Driving School has been teaching driving and bringing smiles to the faces of drivers since 2000. Many competitors have come and gone with their quick-paced strict teaching syllabuses, but we’ve kept our approach the same – friendly and simple.

          Our trained professionals have been serving driving learners from all around the UK without any commute hassle or communication errors. The experience of our company flashes from within our highly competent driving instructors.
          
          The main driving force behind the creation of this company was the immediate need for a good driving instruction center that delivered on promises instead of simply hogging funds. Thus, our company was established as one of the first driving centers where all kinds of trainees and learners of driving could come and learn quickly and effectively.
          
          The whole purpose of the effective yet efficient 5-hour driving course approach is to give people who’ve tried and failed the driving test a chance so they can learn in a calm environment and learn at a rapid pace.</p>

      <div class="col-12 shadow-lg p-5">Why Choose Us?

        Over the course of the past few years, many companies have tried to stand against us and bring a copied approach of 1-day driving courses, but they’ve all failed in front of our tried and tested method of teaching, simply because of our vision.
        
        The main reason why you should choose us over any other 1-day driving learning center is that we’re not here to get you your driving license. Instead, we’re here to provide you an understanding of the art of driving so that you can contribute to a better and safer road environment. Our vision is to make you an expert in driving.</div>

In the last few decades, we have hand-picked incredibly talented drivers from around the UK and brought them to the team of Express Driving Courses. Our team contains more than 10 members who strive to bring you the best of knowledge and services.

This hard-working and professional driving instructor staff is the best in the UK, without a doubt. Their teaching style, understanding your driving issues and helping you overcome your problems and fears are what makes them so good. We’re all hoping to see you learn from the best in the business.
