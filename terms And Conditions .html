                <p class="card-text">Expressdrivingcourses is a driving school-related agency which aims to provide
                   Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) for learner drivers.Expressdrivingcourses advertises as a national establishment
                    covering all UK driving test centers and UK postcodes.  Expressdrivingcourses does not directly employ any ADIs.
                     All associated driving instructors are fully self-employed and responsible for their own financial affairs.,Expressdrivingcourses however, promotes integrity and transparency and is willing to conform to any demands set out by any official government department for 
                     investigation purposes. All ADIs are fully self-employed and responsible for their own tax affairs. Should any government or court authority ask Expressdrivingcourses  to declare information of payments to their registered database of ADIs, however, Expressdrivingcourses will conform fully with any such written request. This information is treated with sensitivity as it can contain personal and private information relating to individuals;
                   as such,Expressdrivingcourses will not breach any data protection laws willingly.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Expressdrivingcourses offers NO guarantees that any pupil will pass the driving test.Expressdrivingcourses also does not guarantee that the duration of the intensive driving course booked by the customer is enough time to prepare them to the point that they can pass their driving test. We do, however, apply over ten years of knowledge in
                   estimating the duration of time best suited to each individual who takes the intensive driving course.</p>
              </div>

                <h5 class="card-title">Learner's Assessment</h5>
              
                <p class="card-text">Expressdrivingcourses will endeavor to accurately gauge each pupil’s current ability at the time of booking. In doing so, we intend to establish the course duration most suitable for the customer. Expressdrivingcourses will NOT, however, be held responsible for miss-selling any service if the customer provides inaccurate information which causes Expressdrivingcourses  to assess the customers course to be either longer or shorter than is actually needed.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Deposit Payments & Disbursements</h5>
              
                <p class="card-text">All intensive driving courses advertised by Expressdrivingcourses require a deposit. Expressdrivingcourses may, however, create an on-the-spot product to satisfy the purchase request of a new customer on an ad-hoc basis; this calculation will take the following into account:<br>
                  1 An agency fee (VAT applicable)<br>
                  
                  2 DVSA test fees (VAT exempt),<br>
                  
                  3 A negotiated hourly or one-off rate for a registered driving instructor.<br>
                  
                  This ensures that any DVSA fee and Driving Instructor fee remains as a disbursement and does not belong to Expressdrivingcourses,  who acts solely as an intermediary. For all disbursements, Expressdrivingcourses will ensure there is a clear, transparent route for all outbound payments classed as disbursements.
                  Any deposit paid to Expressdrivingcourses is an agency fee for the arrangement and management of intensive driving courses. It is common for Expressdrivingcourses to schedule times with a driving instructor. To do so we may make an outbound bank transfer payment to the named driving instructor in order to ensure that they remain available for the agreed timetable. This money is reclaimed when the customer clears the balance of their intensive driving course as advertised in our price structure. Any sum paid out to secure the time with the driving instructor is classed as a disbursement and is recouped at a later date for VAT reasons.</p>
              </div>

                <h5 class="card-title">Balance Payments & Disbursements</h5>
              
                <p class="card-text">All balance payments due for each intensive driving course we sell are regarded as the agreed fee, which we forward to the driving instructor. Therefore, Expressdrivingcourses is only passing the money to the appointed driving instructor to ensure there is no confusion with the customer that their course is being arranged by Expressdrivingcourses.  Any fee for the instructor is not VAT applicable, as none of our registered driving instructors are VAT-registered businesses. The balance acts as their taxable income.</p>

                  through another agency. If the test has been booked by any third party, Expressdrivingcourses cannot be held liable for any discrepancies, cancellations, or missed appointments. We don't. provide practical driving test booking.

                   If the driving instructor feels that the pupil is not at a safe standard of driving, however, they retain the right to refuse the use of their training vehicle for the purpose of the driving test. There are NO grounds for ANY refund should this be the case.</p>

                <p class="card-text">When you book an intensive driving course at Expressdrivingcourses,  must pay a minimum deposit as stated on the company website on the Courses & Prices page.

                   The deposit covers the test fees and the cost of preparing the intensive driving course. Upon booking a course, the labor fee is used to prepare your course, including securing your driving and theory tests. Therefore, the only refundable fees are the ones set aside for the government/DVSA charges for the driving and theory tests. Our online services are not free of charge and are included in the booking fee, known as “the deposit”.
                  
                   We also operate a strict NO REFUND policy on hours that have been paid for any intensive driving course.
